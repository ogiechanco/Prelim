                <h1>First Recognition</h1>

                <p>During my senior high school years, I hardly gained any knowledge—perhaps due to 
                    the pandemic or my own lack of seriousness in studying. However, after graduating
                    , reality hit me hard. I saw my friends, who were in the same academic strand as 
                    mine but from different schools, excelling in their studies and getting into 
                    universities with a solid knowledge base. <br><br>

                    This realization overwhelmed me as I prepared for college, making me 
                    anxious about facing university life without the necessary foundation in 
                    my chosen field. That’s when I decided to start advanced studying. I didn’t 
                    want to be left behind, so before entering college, I took the initiative to 
                    learn basic programming, including Java, HTML, and CSS.<br><br>
                    
                    Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I made. When I started college, 
                    I found my programming subjects much easier to understand because of my prior 
                    self-study. My classmates even started calling me a "smurf," not knowing the 
                    effort and dedication I had put into learning those skills.<br><br>
                    
                    Achieving this milestone made me proud, as it ultimately led me to become a 
                    dean’s lister in my first year of college. I hope to maintain this achievement 
                    in the coming years. I’m sharing this story not to brag but to inspire other 
                    students—hard work and determination truly pay off!</p>

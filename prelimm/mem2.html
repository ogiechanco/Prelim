                <img src="image/card2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" alt="Story Image">
                <p>This story took place when I was 16 years old. My brother invited me to join a 
                    hiking trip to Mount Pulag. We were just joiners, and my brother was introduced 
                    to hiking by his co-worker, so the only person I knew on the journey was him.
                    <br><br>
                    At that time, I was a shy boy with little to no social skills, and I was also 
                    the youngest in the group. Despite that, I was excited for the hike because I 
                    wanted to reach the top of the mountain. However, due to bad weather, the climb 
                    was difficult—the surface was slippery from the rain, making it hard to walk. 
                    Along the way, I faced some challenges, like slipping multiple times and getting
                     my feet soaked in water. But none of that lessened my excitement; I simply 
                     embraced the adventure, knowing it would become one of my core memories.
                     <br><br>
                    When we finally reached the summit, the view was breathtaking. Unfortunately, 
                    because of the rain, it wasn’t as clear as I had hoped, but I still enjoyed the
                     experience. That’s also where my memorable photo was taken.
                     <br><br>
                    However, the real struggle began on the way back. Since it was a downhill 
                    descent, the already slippery trail became even more difficult to navigate, 
                    and I ended up slipping countless times. By the time we returned to our 
                    campsite, I was covered in dirt from head to toe!
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s my story. It might not be the most entertaining, but I hope you enjoyed reading it!</p>

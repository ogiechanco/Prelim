                <p>This story happened when I was in Grade 8. After the school year ended, my high 
                    school friends invited me to go swimming. Excited, I asked my mother for 
                    permission, but she said no. Because of my stubbornness, I cried and begged 
                    her to let me hang out with my friends. She finally responded with these exact
                    words: "Baka may mangyari sa'yong masama" (something bad might happen to you). 
                    Instead of letting me go, she gave me 100 pesos and told me to just go to a 
                    computer shop and play. <br><br>

                    But I was determined to go swimming. So, I messaged my friends and asked them to
                     help me cover the resort fee and transportation costs. With their help, I 
                     managed to escape from the house with my backpack and made my way to the resort.
                     <br><br>
                    
                    Since I had snuck out, I didn’t take many pictures that day. But despite that,
                     I had a great time swimming and bonding with my 
                     friends. However, I wasn’t careful, and after spending so much time in the sun, 
                     my skin noticeably darkened. That’s how I got caught.
                     <br><br>
                    When my mom confronted me, the only thing I said was, "Diba? Wala namang 
                    nangyari sa'king masama." (See? Nothing bad happened to me.)
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s it—hehe.</p>
